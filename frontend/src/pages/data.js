        flowerDesc: 'Known as "a patient reward". The term prairie gentian comes from the area in which this flower is naturally found - the prairies of North America. However, these plants are also grown in South America, Mexico and the Caribbean. The lisianthus is a herbaceous perennial that can also be grown as an annual in cooler weather, adding a great deal of variety to this plant. What makes these flowers more uncommon is the fact that they can take quite a while to grow - up to 20 months in some situations. However, being patient is its own reward, as these gorgeous bell-shaped flowers bloom in the following colours: purple, pink, blue and white. Multicoloured variations are also popular. The bold nature of these plants means they are often used to show appreciation for other people, adding another use for them.',
